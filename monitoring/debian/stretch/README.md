## Installation Script for Zabbix on Debian Stretch Systems

Should also work on
* Ubuntu 17.x Server
* TinkerOS
* Rasbian
* Raspberry PI 3 bootstrapped with https://github.com/braindef/debian_base_on_raspberry3
* Armbian


ARM Systems seem to have a startup issue, you have to start the Service after boot with **/etc/init.d/zabbix-server start**
